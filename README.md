Sorting Visualizer

A web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that visually demonstrates and animates the process of various sorting algorithms. The visualizer supports multiple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, allowing users to observe and compare sorting processes in real-time.

Features
🚀 Interactive UI: Users can select different sorting algorithms to visualize.

🖥️ Real-time Animation: Each sorting algorithm is visualized step-by-step to show how elements are rearranged.

🔄 Multiple Algorithms: Supports algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

📱 Responsive Design: The tool is designed to be used across various devices with a clean and intuitive interface.

How It Works
Bubble Sort
🔄 This algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, continuing the process until the entire array is sorted.

Selection Sort
🔍 The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it into the sorted portion.

Insertion Sort
🧩 Elements are picked from the unsorted portion one at a time and placed in the correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

Technologies Used
HTML 🧑‍💻: For the structure of the web page.

CSS 🎨: For styling and creating the visual layout.

JavaScript 💻: For implementing sorting algorithms and animating the process.
